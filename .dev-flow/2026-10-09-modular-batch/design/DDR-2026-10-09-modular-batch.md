# Design review record — DDR — mapper — Batch 2026-10-09-modular-batch

> **Artifact language.** Canonical **English scaffold**; generate in the batch's language.

> **Owed in.** `core` by trigger · `full` ✓
> **Source:** `/dev-flow-init` step 4's seed-by-mode table, which is this fact's one home. A mode marked `—` **does not owe this artifact, and its absence is not an omission**; `by trigger` means the station exists only when the `triggers` block fired, and `stations_active` in `state.json` is the authority for *this* batch. Where a SECTION or a gate row is owed more narrowly than the artifact, it says so on the row.

> **Where this lives: the VAULT + Drive.** It is **sealed** and **cited by id** from the repo.
> A record in Drive has no diff, no PR and no CI — that is a real boundary of the design, not an
> oversight. The seal is what compensates: **if this record changes after the seal it is a NEW version
> with a NEW id**, never a silent edit, and the requirement that cited the old id keeps pointing at the
> old one — which is exactly the signal you want to see.

> **Notice convention.** `⚠` yellow = notice, declare the reason and continue · `✗` red = block ·
> `✓` green = satisfied **with its evidence cited**. Without a citation an item is asserted, not satisfied.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Record id | `DDR-<batch_id>` |
| Reviews | `<the design proposal id / the lanes joined>` |
| Participants | PDR: `architect` + `qa-reviewer` (+ `ux-reviewer`) · DDR: `architect` + `software-dev` + `qa-reviewer` |
| Date sealed | `2026-10-09` |
| **Verdict** | `approved` / `approved with conditions` / `rejected` |

## A · PDR checklist — preliminary design review

| # | Item | ✓/⚠/✗ | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Proposal complete: objective · modules and boundaries · diagrams · interfaces that change · **proposed test cases** · risks · rejected alternatives **where a real decision exists**, otherwise `n/a — <the decision already made, and by what>` (a row that can only be satisfied by inventing a second design is a row satisfied by invention) | | |
| 2 | Respects the boundaries of `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | | |
| 3 | **Forward applicability:** every output has a NAMED downstream consumer | | |
| 4 | Every requirement has foreseen coverage | | |
| 5 | Proposed test cases are observable **and non-vacuous** — the reddening mutation is named for each | | |
| 6 | The gauntlet controls that apply are declared, with who pays for them | | |
| 7 | Interfaces **frozen** for the fork are listed | | |
| 8 | Lane plan: file sets disjoint, family-B census run per lane | | |
| 9 | UX lens applied (if family D fired): interaction design reviewed | | |
| 10 | Security lens applied (if family C fired) | | |

**No increment starts without an approved PDR.**

## B · DDR checklist — detailed design review · **and the JOIN point when the batch forked**

| # | Item | ✓/⚠/✗ | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | What changed against the PDR, **and why** | | |
| 2 | Frozen interfaces still intact — or the work returned to the trunk and it is declared | | |
| 3 | **Reverse census CROSSED between lanes** (the one check impossible from inside a lane) | | |
| 4 | Every `AT-NNN` realises in **exactly one** on-disk node (C-18) | | |
| 5 | Test ledger **summed** across lanes, reconciled | | |
| 6 | No lane touched another lane's file | | |
| 7 | Source-file budget: any lane that reached or exceeded 4, reviewed here | | |
| 8 | **Every open PDR condition discharged one by one, by RE-READING the artifact** | | |

**A conditional verdict is not an authorisation.** Each condition below is discharged by reading the
artifact that was supposed to change — not by trusting that the corrective pass ran.

| # | Condition left open at PDR | Discharged? | The artifact line that proves it |
|---|---|---|---|

## C · Verdict and what it means

- `approved` — the bar is met on all three axes (Coverage · Certainty · Evidence); state which.
- `approved with conditions` — list them above; each is individually dischargeable and re-read at the next gate.
- `rejected` — **returns to DESIGN, not to implementation.** Name the gap that caused it.

## D · Ids this record binds *(the glue of the repo ↔ vault split)*

| This record's decision | Id | Where it lands in the **repo** |
|---|---|---|
| `<D1 — frozen interface X>` | `<PDR-…#D1>` | `<requirement R-NNN vN / docs/ARCHITECTURE.md>` |

**What decides code lands in the repo.** A decision that fixes an interface does not stay only in the
vault: it is reflected in the requirement or in the module map, which are versioned beside the code.
